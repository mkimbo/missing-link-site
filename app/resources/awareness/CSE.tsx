      description="Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE),is a curriculum-based
      process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional,
      physical and social aspects of sexuality. It aims to equip children
      and young people with knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that
      will empower them to: realize their health, well-being and dignity;
      develop respectful social and sexual relationships; consider how
      their choices affect their own well-being and that of others; and,
      understand and ensure the protection of their rights throughout
      their lives."
