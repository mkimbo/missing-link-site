            Welcome to Missing Link, a transformative community-driven
            initiative dedicated to enhancing public safety through cutting-edge
            technology. Missing Link was born out of the need for a platform
            that leverages technology to provide timely alerts and critical
            information to the community. The service is designed to empower
            individuals and communities to take an active role in public safety.

            In emergencies, swift communication is paramount, and traditional
            methods of broadcasting urgent information often face limitations in
            reaching the highest number of relevant people as quickly as
            possible. Missing Link seeks to address these challenges by
            supplementing and extending current methods, utilizing modern
            technologies to ensure the safety not only of children but also of
            adults and valuable assets such as vehicles and motorbikes.

            With Missing Link, users have the power to broadcast different types
            of alerts to their immediate community during emergencies. Whether
            it&#39;s a missing person, stolen property, or a blood donation
            appeal, the use of PUSH notification technology ensures that
            relevant information reaches the right people at the right time. By
            allowing Missing Link notifications users can contribute to
            community safety effectively.

            Geolocation technology is at the heart of Missing Link. It enables
            the delivery of targeted alerts based on the location of the
            receiver. You&#39;ll receive alerts specifically relevant to your
            neighborhood, allowing you to take prompt action and contribute to
            the safety of your community. Update your location to ensure that
            you only receive information within your community.
